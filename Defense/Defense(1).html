            <p>A monsterous alien has come to terrorize our planet. We could blast him out of existence with our anti-alien ray gun, but its broken and Jeff the IT guy is still kinda miffed about last week (I have no regrets tho). Anyhow, our only option is to send you up there in our magnum opus, the defender 17. You have to keep it out of our atmosphere and destroy it at all costs!</p>
            <div id="controls">
                <h3>Here are the Defender 17 controls</h3>
                <p>W: shoot</p>
                <p>A: move left</p>
                <p>D: move right </p>
                <p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>You've vaporized the alien, good job! You go back home and make the best love to wife you've ever made. Then, you go over to Jeff the IT guy and  suckerpunch him right in the gut</p>

            <p>You were destroyed by the alien. The Defender 17 came down to earth in a fiery meteor destroying a whole city. Your fleight skills go down in history as infamous.</p>
